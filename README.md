# Heart Failure ML Prediction

## Overview
Predict heart failure using clinical features with classical machine learning models. 

## Dataset
Heart Failure Prediction dataset from kaggle
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction

## Methodology
- EDA.
- Features preprocessing.
- Baseline Logistic Regression model.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Dataset contains no missing values or unknown symbols.
- Serveral numerical features show notale linear correlation with the target including Age, RestingBP, FastingBS, and OldPeak.
- No immediate data quality issues identified.

## Project status
- Simple EDA completed.
- Preprocessing strategy defined.
- Model training in process.
